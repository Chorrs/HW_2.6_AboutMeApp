Mark Rothko, real name Markus Yakovlevich Rotkovich; September 25, 1903, Dvinsk, Vitebsk province (now Daugavpils, Latvia) â€“ February 25, 1970, New York) was an American artist from a family of Russian Jews. Included in the "holy Trinity" of abstract expressionism (together with Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning). Despite the phenomenal demand during his lifetime, he was tortured by depression, addiction to tobacco and alcohol. At the peak of his career, he opened his veins, taking an exorbitant dose of antidepressants to be sure. He is known as one of the legislators of color field painting.
